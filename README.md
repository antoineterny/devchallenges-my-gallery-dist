<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

[![screenshot](screenshot.png)](https://devchallenges-my-gallery-dist.vercel.app/)

Working with css grid is always fun ! It is a small project, but took me about 2 hours, because I had fun with gulp...

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), which I used to compile sass, prefix and minify CSS, generate sourcemaps and cache busting postfixes (which is really cool) and also minify the images. I now have a basic gulpfile that I can reuse for my next projects.

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/gcbWLxG6wdennelX7b8I) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.


## Acknowledgements

<!-- This section should list any articles or add-ons/plugins that helps you to complete the project. This is optional but it will help you in the future. For exmpale -->

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/), as always, to get information about filter: drop-shadow() and object-fit CSS properties.
